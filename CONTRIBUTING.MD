# How to contribute

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/QzSG/bluemix-ghost-cloudinary/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature/issue per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Thanks, QzSG
